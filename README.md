# Squid-Proxy
Squid configuration to setup a Windows desktop as a proxy server.

The configuration file sets up the Squid service to listen on port 3128. The proxy is setup to cache some media file formats. Any file format that should be cached, can be added easily to the configuration.

This configuration was written as part of my 2 credit Design Lab course at CSE, IIT KGP. The project extended to writing similar configurations for Linux, and deploying them over a network of Raspberry Pis. This network was used as a heirarchy of proxy caches for a research project.
